 """
Write a Python program to print the documents (syntax, description etc.) of Python built-in function(s).

Sample function: abs()

Python Docstring:

A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object.

All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and classes exported by a module should also have docstrings. Public methods (including the __init__ constructor) should also have docstrings.
